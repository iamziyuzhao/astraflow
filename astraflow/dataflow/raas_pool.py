"""Global thread-safe pool of RaaS2InferenceEngine instances.

``RaaSPool`` wraps N ``RaaS2InferenceEngine`` instances behind the same
duck-typed interface that ``AstraDataAcquisition`` expects.  It is shared
by all agents registered with ``AstraFlowService``.

Key design points
-----------------
- **Single global pool** — all agents share the same pool because every
  RaaS replica bootstraps all agent workflows.
- **Capacity-based routing** — ``submit_auto`` routes to the instance with
  the highest last-known available slot count.
- **Parallel collect** — ``pull_completed`` polls all live instances in
  parallel and merges results.
- **Broadcast-only version notify** — ``notify_all_versions`` fans out to
  all instances in parallel; each RaaS independently handles pause/resume.
- **Suspect-and-confirm failure detection** — data-path methods
  (``pull_completed``, ``get_raas_availability``) mark failing instances as
  *suspect* and wake the heartbeat thread.  Only the heartbeat thread
  increments failure counts and deregisters, keeping the two concerns
  cleanly separated.
- **Lazy workflow registration** — workflow specs are registered on-demand
  on first use via ``RaaS2InferenceEngine._ensure_workflow_registered``.
